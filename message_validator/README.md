# Task
You are given the task of creating a validation library for validate incoming messages (messages package). 
Currently there are two different messages (`UserProfileUpdate.groovy` and `UserBlocked.groovy`), but more will be added in the future, so the validation library needs to be flexible. 

The engineer who started the project has created unit tests in a true test driven fashion, but he did not get very far. There's some tests that pass and some that fails, and more tests needs to be added. 

You can run the tests by executing 'gradle test'

# Task

Implement the validator (see Validator.groovy) and add necessary validations to the UserProfileUpdate.
